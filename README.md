# Rugby

What is the question you hope to answer? 
I hope to accurately predict who will win a rugby match.

What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
Data from 660 matches in the Aviva Premiership over 5 seasons. 
example: http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/232141.html

What do you know about the data so far?
It's messy. Lots of strings that I want to be floats/integers.

Why did you choose this topic?
I'm very much interested in rugby, and sports analytics in general.
